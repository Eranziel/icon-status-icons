# icon-status-icons
Simple Foundry VTT module which adds status icons for the ICON RPG by Massif Press. While they are targeted towards ICON, the module is not system restricted so can be used with any.

Icon graphics are a combination of the work of Archer on PilotNET (the LANCER Discord server) and https://game-icons.net/.

## Installation
Manifest URL: [https://github.com/Eranziel/icon-status-icons/raw/main/module.json](https://github.com/Eranziel/icon-status-icons/releases/latest/download/system.json)

Copy the manifest into the matching box in the Foundry module installation dialog, and Foundry will take care of the rest!

## Settings
The module settings allow users to customize the added icons on a per-world basis. The "Keep Stock Icons" setting allows users to either keep or remove the stock Foundry status icons.
